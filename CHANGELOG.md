# Changelog

## 2026-04-02 (Full-deploy script + .gitignore + playwright devDep)

### Added

- `scripts/jira-automation-full-deploy.mjs` — fully non-interactive Playwright script to create Jira rules 1.1–1.3 and disable 1.4; takes debug screenshots to `scripts/deploy-screenshots/`; includes `waitForURL` fix (explicit string cast to handle Playwright URL objects); replaces `jira-deploy-fixed.mjs` (deleted as duplicate)
- `.gitignore` — excludes `node_modules/`, `scripts/deploy-screenshots/`, `scripts/*.png`, `.env`

### Changed

- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — added `playwright@^1.59.1` as devDependency (already installed globally, pinned here for reproducibility)
- `scripts/playwright-jira-automation.mjs` — minor fix from prior session

---

## 2026-04-02 (Playwright automation scripts for Jira rules + Rovo Studio)

### Added

- `scripts/jira-automation-deploy.mjs` — Playwright script to automatically deploy Jira automation rules 1.1–1.4; uses Edge persistent profile (falls back to fresh Chromium); navigates to UKCAUD/UKCAS automation settings pages; finds rules by name pattern; enables rules 1.1/1.2/1.3, disables rule 1.4 (resolution recommender); calls `PATCH /api/automation` on localhost:3000 to update dashboard tracking; supports `--dry-run` flag
- `scripts/rovo-studio-enable.mjs` — Playwright script to enable Rovo Studio agents 2.1 (Readiness Checker) and 2.2 (Theme Analyzer); tries multiple known Rovo Studio URLs automatically; finds agents by name pattern; clicks Enable button; updates dashboard via `PATCH /api/automation`; supports `--dry-run` flag

---

## 2026-04-02 (Microsoft Graph OAuth2 setup script)

### Added

- `scripts/setup-graph-token.ps1` — one-time device code flow OAuth2 setup for Microsoft Graph; requests `Calendars.ReadWrite offline_access User.Read` scopes; polls for auth completion with `authorization_pending`/`slow_down`/`expired_token` handling; verifies token against `GET /me`; saves `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`, `user_email`, etc. to `workspace/coordinator/graph-token.json`; enables the dashboard calendar panel and `/focus` command

---

## 2026-04-02 (Jira automation status sync script)

### Added

- `scripts/check-jira-automation-status.mjs` — queries the Jira Automation 1.0 REST API to detect which automation rules (phases 1.1–1.4) are live/disabled and syncs status into `workspace/coordinator/dashboard-data.json`; supports `--dry-run` flag; skips Rovo Studio agents (2.1/2.2) which require manual confirmation; never downgrades manually confirmed 'deployed' status

---

## 2026-04-02 (AutomationStatus dashboard panel + Jira rule tracking API)

### Added

- `dashboard/components/AutomationStatus.tsx` — new dashboard panel showing all 6 Jira automation rules (phases 1.1–2.2) with color-coded status badges (pending/deployed/blocked/disabled), phase labels, Jira deep-links, and one-click "Done" buttons to mark rules deployed
- `dashboard/app/api/automation/route.ts` — REST API for automation rule status: GET returns current rules from dashboard-data.json; PATCH updates individual rule status (sets `deployedAt` on deploy, clears it on block, stores `blockedReason`)

### Changed

- `dashboard/app/page.tsx` — added AutomationStatus as a 3rd panel in column 4 (below Calendar and TimeTracker), with flex-1 to fill remaining height
- `dashboard/types/dashboard.ts` — added `AutomationRule`, `AutomationRuleStatus` types and `automationRules` field on `DashboardData`
- `dashboard/data/dashboard-data.json` + `workspace/coordinator/dashboard-data.json` — populated `automationRules` section with 6 rules covering phases 1.1 (retro enrichment), 1.2 (enhancement routing), 1.3 (epic done sync), 1.4 (disable stale rule), 2.1 (readiness checker), 2.2 (theme analyzer); all start as `pending`
